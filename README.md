My Calendly
===========

Let's make a calendly, in react/python because:
- it's been a while I hadn't done react or python
- why would I pay for calendly when I can make my own?


## Features

Don't care about what the notion says, everything's here:

- MUST: Someone (with the link) can book a slot in my calendar.
  - [ ] system must access my google calendar to check for availability
  - [ ] system must propose 30-60mn slots based on my availability
  - [ ] when user choses, the slot is booked in my calendar...
  - [ ] ...and he receives a confirmation email

Ideas
- reschedule
- Set availabilities periods (e.g. my gcal between 6am to 11pm, weekdays only)
- user log in + sync w/ his gcal/outlook/others
- propose a new time for VIPs
- VIP - have access to more slots
- Reminders workflows
- filtered on who is invited
- set increments
- limit events per day/week/month
- force a notice period of X h/d/w
- cannot plan too much on the future
- visio link
- pro plan: round robin ppl on the team
- pro plan: workflow to plan another meeting in the future [use case: screen meeting, technical test, debrief, onsite]
- phone or visio
- set a buffer between meetings
- set a buffer after meetings
- pro plan: ultra VIPs can book outside of availabilities
- various duration : 15-30-45...mn
- PRO: multiple hosts
- PRO: multiple guests needs to have same availabilities (e.g. doodle)
- PRO: program a meeting on behalf of someone else (e.g. I give my link to corentin, he sends to his client, the client books in mine but corentin knows)
